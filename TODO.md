## Todo list

- Get all the F8 options for pubs, location, keywords, etc in C:\RM\Database\
    * Authors:          NEW.M4
    * Bindings:         NEW.M13
    * Categories:       NEW.M2
    * Editions:         NEW.M12
    * Keywords:         NEW.K1
    * Locations:        NEW.M10
    * Conditions:       NEW.M6
    * Lower conditions: NEW.M17
    * Publishers:       NEW.M9

- Figure out how to get match multiple publishers
    * For example, `Nan A. Talese/Doubleday` catches the Doubleday before it gets to the Nan A. Talese part

- Also figure out shortened names for publishers so it doesn't have to try matching the whole alias? Or just stick more/ better aliases in for pubs
