# RecordManagerImport

A program where you can input an isbn, and it will pull the book's data (If available) from https://openlibrary.org/, parse it, and put it into a file that AutoHotKey can read. From there, AHK switches to the RecordManager window, then goes through and inputs all the data in the appropriate fields.
