# RecordManagerImport

A program where you can input an isbn, and it will pull the book's data (If available) from https://openlibrary.org/, parse it, and put it into a file that AutoHotKey can read. From there, AHK switches to the RecordManager window, then goes through and inputs all the data in the appropriate fields.


## Requirements

* AutoHotKey/ AHK (https://www.autohotkey.com/)
* Interloc Record Manager (We have v2.10, not sure if available anywhere nowadays)
